EMIPLIB TODO list:

 * Make the video RTP encoder and decoder compliant with standards. Currently,
   a simple ad hoc encoding scheme is used. This should obviously change.
 * Add codecs for video.
 * In the MS-Windows version: change the project file to allow the file 
   mipqtoutput.moc to be generated automatically.
 * Improve the ALSA output component.
 * Add 8-bit sample support to the ESD output component.
 * Rewrite the audio session to allow a choice between available input 
   and output components.
